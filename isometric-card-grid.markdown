Isometric Card Grid
-------------------
A remake of an [older demo](https://codepen.io/jkantner/details/xOxxXV/), which is a [Codrops-inspired](https://tympanus.net/Development/IsometricGrids/index.html) scrollable grid component. This time, I used CSS grid to organize the cards, a vanilla CSS variable to control the scrolling, and much less JavaScript.

Due to use of some modern CSS techniques, this demo wonâ€™t work properly in IE.

Update 1/9/20: Respects dark mode now
